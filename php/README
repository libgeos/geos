The code in this directory provides a PHP module to
make use of functionalities of the GEOS library.
The bindings are linked to the C-API, for betters stability.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

You need php5 development tools, often found in
packages named something like 'php5-dev'. 

BUILD
-----

Just add --enable-php to your GEOS configure line
and run 'make'.

TESTING
-------

Automated testing should be executed on 'make check'
togheter with the rest of the GEOS testsuite.
You can still run 'make check' from this dir for
localized (php-only) testing.

Note that you'll need phpunit installed for this to work.
To install:

  sudo pear install --force --alldeps phpunit/phpunit

INSTALL
-------

As root (or owner with write access to the directory
returned by php-config --extension-dir),
run 'make install'

USAGE
-----

 ... TODO ...
 (reference some automatically built doc?)
