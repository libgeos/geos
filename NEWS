- Ported JTS robustness patch for RobustLineIntersector
- Removed useless Coordinate copies in OverlayOp::mergeZ() 
- Avoided throws by IsValid on invalid input
- Stricter C++ syntax (math.h=>cmath, ieeefp.h in "C" block, ostringstream
  instead of sprintf)
- Better support for older compilers (Polygonizer::LineStringAdder friendship)
- Removed useless Coordinate copies in CGAlgorithms::isOnLine()

- Debian package build scripts 


Changes in 2.1.0

- Added Polygonizer and LineMerger classes.
- python wrapper examples
- General cleanup / warnings removal
- cleaner win32 / older copilers builds
- Reduced heap allocations
- debian package builder scripts
- reduction of standard C lib headers dependency
- Z support in overlay operations.


Changes in 2.0.0

- CoordinateList renamed to CoordinateSequence, BasicCoordinateList
  renamed to DefaultCoordinateSequence to reflect JTS changes.
  DefaultCoordinateSequenceFactory and CoordinateSequenceFactory
  got same interface as JTS.
- Added geos/version.h defining versioning infos
- Added geos.h for quick inclusion. It will include geos/geom.h,
  new geos/version.h, geos/util.h geos/io.h and geos/unload.h
  (geometry input/output, exceptions, operations).
- Added a geos::version() function showing GEOS and equivalent
  JTS versions as strings.
- All geometry constructors take ownership of given arguments.
  GeometryFactory provides pass-by-reference geometry creators
  to take care of a deep-copy.
- GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList *)
  has been renamed to
  GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList &)
  to reflect copy semantic
- GeometryFactory: EMPTY geometry creation do now have their
  own constructors taking no arguments.
- Geometry constructors taking PrecisionModel and SRID have
  been dropped. You have to use GeometryFactory instead.
- WKTWriter default constructor has been dropped. You need
  to initialize it with an explicit GeometryFactory
