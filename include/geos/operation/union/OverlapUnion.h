/** \brief
 * Unions MultiPolygons efficiently by using full topological union only
 * for polygons which may overlap by virtue of intersecting the common
 * area of the inputs.
 *
 * Other polygons are simply combined with the union result, which is much
 * more performant.
 *
 * This situation is likely to occur during cascaded polygon union,
 * since the partitioning of polygons is done heuristically
 * and thus may group disjoint polygons which can lie far apart.
 * It may also occur in real world data which contains many disjoint polygons
 * (e.g. polygons representing parcels on different street blocks).
 *
 * # Algorithm
 *
 * The overlap region is determined as the common envelope of intersection.
 * The input polygons are partitioned into two sets:
 *
 * * Overlapping: Polygons which intersect the overlap region, and thus potentially overlap each other
 * * Disjoint: Polygons which are disjoint from (lie wholly outside) the overlap region
 *
 * The Overlapping set is fully unioned, and then combined with the Disjoint set.
 * Performing a simple combine works because
 * the disjoint polygons do not interact with each
 * other (since the inputs are valid MultiPolygons).
 * They also do not interact with the Overlapping polygons,
 * since they are outside their envelope.
 *
 * # Verification
 *
 * In the general case the Overlapping set of polygons will
 * extend beyond the overlap envelope.  This means that the union result
 * will extend beyond the overlap region.
 * There is a small chance that the topological
 * union of the overlap region will shift the result linework enough
 * that the result geometry intersects one of the Disjoint geometries.
 * This case is detected and if it occurs
 * is remedied by falling back to performing a full union of the original inputs.
 * Detection is done by a fairly efficient comparison of edge segments which
 * extend beyond the overlap region.  If any segments have changed
 * then there is a risk of introduced intersections, and full union is performed.
 *
 * This situation has not been observed in JTS using floating precision,
 * but it could happen due to snapping.  It has been observed
 * in other APIs (e.g. GEOS) due to more aggressive snapping.
 * And it will be more likely to happen if a snap-rounding overlay is used.
 *
 * DEPRECATED: This optimization has been removed, since it impairs performance.
