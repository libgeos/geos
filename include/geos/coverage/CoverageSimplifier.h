/**
 * Simplifies the boundaries of the polygons in a polygonal coverage
 * while preserving the original coverage topology.
 * An area-based simplification algorithm
 * (similar to Visvalingam-Whyatt simplification)
 * is used to provide high-quality results.
 * Also supports simplifying just the inner edges in a coverage,
 * which allows simplifying "patches" without affecting their boundary.
 *
 * The amount of simplification is determined by a tolerance value,
 * which is a non-negative quantity. It equates roughly to the maximum
 * distance by which a simplified line can change from the original.
 * (In fact, it is the square root of the area tolerance used
 * in the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm.)
 *
 * The simplified result coverage has the following characteristics:
 *
 *   * It has the same number and types of polygonal geometries as the input
 *   * Node points (inner vertices shared by three or more polygons,
 *     or boundary vertices shared by two or more) are not changed
 *   * If the input is a valid coverage, then so is the result
 *
 * This class also supports inner simplification, which simplifies
 * only edges of the coverage which are adjacent to two polygons.
 * This allows partial simplification of a coverage, since a simplified
 * subset of a coverage still matches the remainder of the coverage.
 *
 * The input coverage should be valid according to {@link CoverageValidator}.
