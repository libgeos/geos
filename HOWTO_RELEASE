1: Increment CAPI_INTERFACE_X in configure.in
   - For a release with no interface changes just bump REVISION.
     [ Even if *nothing* changed in CAPI ]
   - Adding interfaces, bump CURRENT/AGE, set REVISION to 0.
   - Deleting interfaces / compatibility issues - bump CURRENT, others to zero
     [ THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED ]

2: Increment release version:
   - VERSION_PATCH for bugfixes/improvements (even breaking C++ API)
   - VERSION_MINOR for NEW interfaces in the C lib
   - VERSION_MAJOR for SUBSTANTIAL additions or C lib ABI break
     [ THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED ]
   
3: Release-mark the ChangeLog (search for '---' at start of a line to 
   see how a release mark looks like).

4: Update the NEWS file (extract most important things from the ChangeLog)

5: make distcheck

6: check everything is ok ;)

7: Tag the release:
   $ base=http://svn.osgeo.org/geos/
   $ svn copy -m "Tagged release MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" \
		$base/trunk $base/tags/MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
