SWIG generated GEOS module for Python
=====================================

Installation
------------

Although the pre-release GEOS in CVS is not quite ready to be installed, one
can build and install a Python geos module from CVS.

Starting in the top-level geos directory:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

Do *not* install the pre-release GEOS

$ cd swig/python
$ swig -c++ -python -modern -o geos_wrap.cxx ../geos.i
$ python setup.py build
$ python tests/runtests.py -v
$ sudo python setup.py install


Testing
-------

The beginning of a unit testing framework is found under swig/python/tests.
For now there is one (1) test, just enough to make sure that the library can
be imported and demonstrate some usage.  Whether or not more tests will be
written depends on whether the GEOS developers pick up on using Python for
unit testing and whether or not I (Sean) get more involved with GEOS 
development.


Usage
-----

The module generated by SWIG will have an API very much like the C++ API,
but with a flattened namespace.
