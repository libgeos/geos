SWIG generated GEOS module
==========================

:Author: Sean Gillies

Manifest
--------

The main interface file is geos.i.  Makefiles and specific instructions for
target languages will be found in directories named for the target language.
Currently Python is the only language supported.  Contributions are welcome,
but the author (Sean) has no plans to write Makefiles for other languages.


Generating Module Source
------------------------

Change directory to the target language directory, and note that the 
following build instructions may be superceded by instructions in any
language specific README.txt or INSTALL.txt file.

To generate the module wrapper source, run swig substituting your target
language for TARGET_LANG

::
    $ swig -c++ -TARGET_LANG -o geos_wrap.cxx ../geos.i

You should use a very recent SWIG release, 1.3.20+.  The result will be a
pair of files: one geos module file for the target language (geos.py in the
Python case), and a geos_wrap.cxx file, the source for the _geos shared 
library.


Installation
------------

See the SWIG documentation

  http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIGPlus.html#n5

for guidance on building the _geos shared library for any language.  Python
users should read python/INSTALL.txt and use the python/setup.py distutils
script.


Usage
-----

The module generated by SWIG will have an API very much like the C++ API,
but with a flattened namespace.
