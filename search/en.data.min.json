Minor versions typically contain new features, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements. Minor versions have version numbers in the form major.minor (e.g. 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, etc).\nEach minor version has a named git branch (e.g. branch 3.11). The first release of a minor version has a micro version of x.x.0 and is git tagged. For example, the first release of version 3.11 was 3.11.0 and has git tag 3.11.0.\nPatch Policy On an as-needed basis, each supported minor version will have additional micro releases (e.g. 3.10.1,3.10.2). These subsequent micro releases may have bug fixes, performance improvements, and security fixes but will not include new features. They are patch releases for the parent minor version. Micro releases are git tagged with the version number (e.g. tag 3.10.1).\nThe newer the minor version, the more likely performance improvements will be added. Performance improvements that could destabilize a release (e.g. requiring too much code) or change behavior will generally not be applied. Bug fixes that are not trivial changes of code or major security or crash issues, will likely not be applied to older versions. The latest stable release (meaning the minor release with highest number that is not the main branch) will have all bug fixes and enhancements which are not new features. End-of-Life Policy Minor versions marked EOL will not have further releases. We may apply fixes to a minor branch if an entity is willing to fund such an effort, but the change will not be tagged.\nThe policy for making a minor version EOL is:\nIf the first release of the minor version is more than 3-5 years old, it may become EOL. When a minor version is EOL, it will either be removed from Downloads or will have an EOL marker showing it is the last release for the minor version.\n","description":"RFC 11 End-of-Life (EOL) Policy Author Regina Obe Contact lr@pcorp.us Status Accepted, September 20, 2022 This document describes the GEOS project policy for versioning and EOLing GEOS minor versions.\nVersioning The GEOS project generally produces a new minor version every 1-2 years.

We expect it to be honored by everyone who participates in the GEOS community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the GEOS project.\nIt applies to in-person events (such as conferences and related social events), IRC, public and private mailing lists, the issue tracker, the wiki, blogs, Twitter, and any other forums which the community uses for communication and interactions.\nThis code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\nDiversity Statement GEOS welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining, and we will always work to treat everyone well. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.\nSpecific Guidelines We strive to:\nBe open.\nWe invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be more easily detected and corrected.\nBe empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.\nWe work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Note that we have a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and some of us are non-native speakers. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.\nBe collaborative.\nOur work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of GEOS, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.\nBe inquisitive.\nNobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving GEOS.\nBe careful in the words that we choose.\nWhether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.\nBe concise\nKeep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.\nTry to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each mail adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.\nTry to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.\nStep down considerately.\nMembers of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project’s goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual’s choice to leave the project.\nAnti-Harassment Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\nPersonal insults or discriminatory jokes and language, especially those using racist or sexist terms. Offensive comments, excessive or unnecessary profanity. Intimidation, violent threats or demands. Sustained disruption of sessions or events. Stalking, harassing photography or recording. Unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”). Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour. Reporting Guidelines If you believe someone is breaking this code of conduct, you may reply to them, and point to this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.\nShould there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your concerns to event staff, a forum leader or the GEOS PSC. Serious or persistent offenders may be expelled from the event or forum by event organizers or forum leaders.\nTo privately email the code of conduct committee leadership use conduct-report@osgeo.org.\nCredits GEOS reuses the OSGeo Code of Conduct\n","description":"Introduction This code of conduct governs how we behave in any GEOS forum or event and whenever we will be judged by our actions.

The C API offers several benefits:\nStable API, that preserves behaviour and function naming over multiple releases. Stable ABI, allowing new binaries to be dropped into place without requiring a rebuild of dependent applications. Simple access pattern, using the simple features model as the basis for most operations. In exchange for this simplicity and stability, the C API has a few requirements from application authors:\nExplicit memory management. If you create a GEOS object with a GEOS function, you must free it using the appropriate GEOS destructor. The C API is contained in the geos_c.h header file.\nBuilding a Program The simplest GEOS C API application needs to include the API header, declare a message handler, initialize the GEOS globals, and link to the GEOS C library when built.\n/* geos_hello_world.c */ #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; /* for printf */ #include \u0026lt;stdarg.h\u0026gt; /* for va_list */ /* Only the CAPI header is required */ #include \u0026lt;geos_c.h\u0026gt; /* * GEOS requires two message handlers to return * error and notice message to the calling program. * * typedef void(* GEOSMessageHandler) (const char *fmt,...) * * Here we stub out an example that just prints the * messages to stdout. */ static void geos_msg_handler(const char* fmt, ...) { va_list ap; va_start(ap, fmt); vprintf (fmt, ap); va_end(ap); } int main() { /* Send notice and error messages to the terminal */ initGEOS(geos_msg_handler, geos_msg_handler); /* Read WKT into geometry object */ GEOSWKTReader* reader = GEOSWKTReader_create(); GEOSGeometry* geom_a = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, \u0026#34;POINT(1 1)\u0026#34;); /* Convert result to WKT */ GEOSWKTWriter* writer = GEOSWKTWriter_create(); char* wkt = GEOSWKTWriter_write(writer, geom_a); printf(\u0026#34;Geometry: %s\\n\u0026#34;, wkt); /* Clean up allocated objects */ GEOSWKTReader_destroy(reader); GEOSWKTWriter_destroy(writer); GEOSGeom_destroy(geom_a); GEOSFree(wkt); /* Clean up the global context */ finishGEOS(); return 0; } When compiling the program, remember to link in the GEOS C library.\ncc geos_hello_world.c -o geos_hello_world -l geos_c Reentrant/Threadsafe API GEOS functions provide reentrant variants, indicated by an _r suffix. The reentrant functions work the same as their regular counterparts, but they have an extra parameter, a GEOSContextHandle_t.\nThe GEOSContextHandle_t carries a thread-local state that is equivalent to the state initialized by the initGEOS() call in the simple example above.\nTo use the reentrant API, call GEOS_init_r() instead of initGEOS() to create a context local to your thread. Each thread that will be running GEOS operations should create its own context prior to working with the GEOS API.\nIn this example the overall structure of the code is identical, but the reentrant variants are used, and the preamble and cleanup are slightly different.\n/* geos_hello_world.c */ #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; /* for printf */ #include \u0026lt;stdarg.h\u0026gt; /* for va_list */ /* Only the CAPI header is required */ #include \u0026lt;geos_c.h\u0026gt; static void geos_msg_handler(const char* fmt, ...) { va_list ap; va_start(ap, fmt); vprintf (fmt, ap); va_end(ap); } int main() { /* Send notice and error messages to the terminal */ GEOSContextHandle_t ctx = GEOS_init_r (); GEOSContext_setNoticeHandler_r(ctx, geos_msg_handler); GEOSContext_setErrorHandler_r(ctx, geos_msg_handler); /* Read WKT into geometry object */ GEOSWKTReader* reader = GEOSWKTReader_create_r(ctx); GEOSGeometry* geom_a = GEOSWKTReader_read_r(ctx, reader, \u0026#34;POINT(1 1)\u0026#34;); /* Convert result to WKT */ GEOSWKTWriter* writer = GEOSWKTWriter_create_r(ctx); char* wkt = GEOSWKTWriter_write_r(ctx, writer, geom_a); printf(\u0026#34;Geometry: %s\\n\u0026#34;, wkt); /* Clean up allocated objects */ GEOSWKTReader_destroy_r(ctx, reader); GEOSWKTWriter_destroy_r(ctx, writer); GEOSGeom_destroy_r(ctx, geom_a); GEOSFree_r(ctx, wkt); /* Clean up the global context */ GEOS_finish_r(ctx); return 0; } Object Model The GEOSCoordSequence and GEOSGeometry objects are at the heart of the GEOS object model.\nGEOSCoordSequence GEOSCoordSequence is an ordered list of coordinates. Coordinates are 2 (XY) or 3 (XYZ) dimensional.\nThere are a number of ways to make a GEOSCoordSequence. You can create a GEOSCoordSequence by creating a blank one and then setting the coordinate values.\ndouble xList[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; double yList[] = {3.0, 2.0, 1.0}; size_t seqSize = 3; size_t seqDims = 2; GEOSCoordSequence* seq = GEOSCoordSeq_create(seqSize, seqDims); for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; seqSize; i++) { seq-\u0026gt;setXY(i, xList[i], yList[i]); } GEOSCoordSeq_destroy(seq); You can also create a GEOSCoordSequence and initialize it from coordinate arrays.\ndouble xList[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; double yList[] = {3.0, 2.0, 1.0}; size_t seqSize = 3; GEOSCoordSequence* seq = GEOSCoordSeq_copyFromArrays( xList, yList, NULL, /* Zs */ NULL, /* Ms */ seqSize); GEOSCoordSeq_destroy(seq); Finally, you can create a GEOSCoordSequence and initialize it from a coordinate buffer (an array of double in coordinate order, eg: XYXYXY).\n/* Coordinates in a buffer (X,Y, X,Y, X,Y) */ double coordBuf[] = {1.0,3.0, 2.0,2.0, 3.0,1.0}; size_t seqSize = 3; GEOSCoordSequence* seq = GEOSCoordSeq_copyFromBuffer( coordBuf, seqSize, 0, /* hasZ */ 0 /* hasM */ ); GEOSCoordSeq_destroy(seq); Note that while you can reclaim the memory for a GEOSCoordSequence directly using GEOSCoordSeq_destroy(), you usually will not have to since creating a GEOSGeometry with a GEOSCoordSequence hands ownership of the sequence to the new geometry.\nWhen writing data back from GEOS to whatever application you are using, you have the option of using a standard serialization format like WKB (see below) or by writing back to arrays or buffers.\nGEOSCoordSeq_copyToArrays() GEOSCoordSeq_copyToBuffer() Using the array or buffer methods can often be faster than using direct coordinate reading or serialization formats, if the target structures use coordinate arrays or XY binary buffers.\nGEOSGeometry The fundamental structure of the GEOS C API is GEOSGeometry. GEOSGeometry is a generic type that can be a Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, or GeometryCollection. Most functions in the GEOS C API have a GEOSGeometry as a parameter or return type. When GEOSGeometry values have been created they must be deallocated using GEOSGeom_destroy().\nThere are many constructors for GEOSGeometry:\nGEOSGeom_createPoint() GEOSGeom_createPointFromXY() GEOSGeom_createLinearRing() GEOSGeom_createLineString() GEOSGeom_createPolygon() GEOSGeom_createCollection() GEOSGeom_createEmptyPoint() GEOSGeom_createEmptyLineString() GEOSGeom_createEmptyPolygon() GEOSGeom_createEmptyCollection() The createEmpty functions take no arguments and return geometries that are \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo;. Empty geometries represent a (typed) empty set of space. For example, the intersection of two disjoint polygons is a \u0026ldquo;empty polygon\u0026rdquo;.\nThe GEOSGeom_createPoint(), GEOSGeom_createLinearRing() and GEOSGeom_createLineString() functions accept a single GEOSCoordSequence and take ownership of that sequence, so freeing the geometry with GEOSGeom_destroy() frees all the allocated memory.\ndouble coordBuf[] = {1.0,3.0, 2.0,2.0, 3.0,1.0}; size_t seqSize = 3; GEOSCoordSequence* seq = GEOSCoordSeq_copyFromBuffer( coordBuf, seqSize, 0, 0); /* Takes ownership of sequence */ GEOSGeometry* geom = GEOSGeom_createLineString(seq); /* Frees all memory */ GEOSGeom_destroy(geom); The GEOSGeom_createPolygon() and GEOSGeom_createCollection() functions both require an array of inputs:\nan array of inner ring GEOSCoordSequence to create polygons; and, an array of GEOSGeometry to create collections. As in the other creation functions, ownership of the contained objects is transferred to the new geometry. However, ownership of the array that holds the contained objects is not transferred.\n/* Two points in an array */ size_t npoints = 2; GEOSGeometry** points = malloc(sizeof(GEOSGeometry*) * npoints); points[0] = GEOSGeom_createPointFromXY(0.0, 0.0); points[1] = GEOSGeom_createPointFromXY(0.0, 0.0); /* takes ownership of the points in the array */ /* but not the array itself */ GEOSGeometry* collection = GEOSGeom_createCollection( GEOS_MULTIPOINT, /* collection type */ points, /* geometry array */ npoints); /* frees collection and contained points */ GEOSGeom_destroy(collection); /* frees the containing array */ free(points); Readers and Writers The examples above build GEOSCoordSequences from arrays of double, and GEOSGeometry from coordinate sequences, but it is also possible to directly read from and write to standard geometry formats:\nWell-Known Text (WKT) Well-Known Binary (WKB) GeoJSON For example, reading and writing WKT:\nconst char* wkt_in = \u0026#34;POLYGON((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))\u0026#34;; /* Read the WKT into geometry object */ GEOSWKTReader* reader = GEOSWKTReader_create(); GEOSGeometry* geom = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, wkt_in); /* Convert geometry back to WKT */ GEOSWKTWriter* writer = GEOSWKTWriter_create(); /* Trim trailing zeros off output; only needed before GEOS 3.12 */ GEOSWKTWriter_setTrim(writer, 1); char* wkt_out = GEOSWKTWriter_write(writer, geom); /* Clean up everything we allocated */ GEOSWKTReader_destroy(reader); GEOSGeom_destroy(geom); /* Use GEOSFree() to free memory allocated inside GEOS~ */ GEOSFree(wkt_out); Note that the output WKT string is freed using GEOSFree(), not the system free(). This ensures that the same library that allocates the memory also frees it, which is important for some platforms (Windows primarily).\nFor more information about the specific options available for each format, see the documentation for the various readers and writers.\nGEOSWKTReader / GEOSWKTWriter GEOSWKBReader / GEOSWKBWriter GEOSGeoJSONReader / GEOSGeoJSONWriter For a complete example using a reader and writer, see capi_read.c.\nPrepared Geometry The GEOS \u0026ldquo;prepared geometry\u0026rdquo; is conceptually similar to a database \u0026ldquo;prepared statement\u0026rdquo;: by doing up-front work to create an optimized object, you reap a performance benefit when executing repeated function calls on that object.\nPrepared geometries contain internal indexes that make calls to the \u0026ldquo;spatial predicate\u0026rdquo; functions like GEOSPreparedIntersects() and GEOSPreparedContains() much much faster. These are functions that take in two geometries and return true or false.\nIf you are going to be making repeated calls to predicates on the same geometry, using a prepared geometry could be a big performance boost, at the cost of a little extra complexity.\n/* One concave polygon */ const char* wkt = \u0026#34;POLYGON ((189 115, 200 170, 130 170, 35 242, 156 215, 210 290, 274 256, 360 190, 267 215, 300 50, 200 60, 189 115))\u0026#34;; /* Read the WKT into geometry objects */ GEOSWKTReader* reader = GEOSWKTReader_create(); GEOSGeometry* geom = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, wkt); GEOSWKTReader_destroy(reader); /* Prepare the geometry */ const GEOSPreparedGeometry* prep_geom = GEOSPrepare(geom); /* Make a point to test */ GEOSGeometry* pt = GEOSGeom_createPointFromXY(190, 200); /* Check if the point and polygon intersect */ if (GEOSPreparedIntersects(prep_geom, pt)) { /* done something ... */ } /* Note that both prepared and original geometry are destroyed */ GEOSPreparedGeom_destroy(prep_geom); GEOSGeom_destroy(geom); GEOSGeom_destroy(pt); For a complete example of using prepared geometry to accelerate multiple predicate tests, see the capi_prepared.c example.\nSTRTree Index The STRTree index allows you to create, populate, and query a spatial index. Like most spatial indexes, the STRTree is based on indexing rectangles. For a complete example using a reader and writer, see capi_strtree.c.\nWhen you build an index, you will usually insert an \u0026ldquo;item\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; some kind of struct that you are interested in indexing \u0026ndash; and an associated bounds for that item, in the form of a GEOSGeometry. The geometry does not need to be rectangular, a rectangular bounding box will be automatically calculated for the geometry.\nOnce you have built an STRTree, you have two basic ways to query:\nFind the nearest item to a query geometry, using GEOSSTRtree_nearest_generic() Find all the items that intersect with a query rectangle, using GEOSSTRtree_query() Build the tree by creating it, then inserting items.\n/* * An application will want to index items, which have * some attributes and a geometry part. */ typedef struct { GEOSGeometry* geom; size_t id; } item; /* * The tree doesn\u0026#39;t take ownership of inputs just * holds references, so we keep our point field * handy in an array */ item* items[nItems]; /* * The create parameter for the tree is not the * number of inputs, it is the number of entries * per node. 10 is a good default number to use. */ GEOSSTRtree* tree = GEOSSTRtree_create(10); for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; nItems; i++) { /* Make a random point */ item* obj = random_item(range); /* Store away a reference so we can free it after */ items[i] = obj; /* Add an entry for it to the tree */ GEOSSTRtree_insert(tree, obj-\u0026gt;geom, obj); } Note that the index does not take ownership of the inserted GEOSGeometry or the item, it just stores pointers. So remember to keep a list of the items you create in order to free them at the end of your process.\nOnce the tree is built, you can query it.\nThe generic nearest-neighbor query uses a callback to check the actual distance between the search item and the indexed item. In this way it can filter through the many candidate nearest nodes in the index to find the actual nearest node.\n/* * Item distance callback for GEOSSTRtree_nearest_generic() */ int itemDistanceCallback(const void* item1, const void* item2, double* distance, void* userdata) { item_t* obj1 = (item_t*)item1; item_t* obj2 = (item_t*)item2; return GEOSDistance(obj1-\u0026gt;geom, obj2-\u0026gt;geom, distance); } The query call requires the tree, the item driving the search (so it can be fed into the callback), the geometry driving the search (because the library doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to extract the geometry from the item a priori), the callback, and whatever extra information want sent into the callback.\n/* Random item to query the index with */ item_t* item_random = random_item(range); /* Nearest item in the index to our random item */ const item_t* item_nearest = GEOSSTRtree_nearest_generic( tree, // STRTree to query item_random, // Item to use in search item_random-\u0026gt;geom, // Geometry to seed search itemDistanceCallback, // Callback to process nearest object NULL); // Userdata to hand to the callback The query by rectangle function also uses a callback, which could be used to exactly test for a spatial relationship (intersects, contains, etc), for all the index nodes that meet the rough \u0026ldquo;bounds interact\u0026rdquo; filter the index applies.\n/* * Item query callback for GEOSSTRtree_query() */ void itemQueryCallback(void* item, void* userdata) { double x, y; item_t* i = (item_t*)item; GEOSGeomGetX(i-\u0026gt;geom, \u0026amp;x); GEOSGeomGetY(i-\u0026gt;geom, \u0026amp;y); printf(\u0026#34;Found item %10zu at (%g, %g)\\n\u0026#34;, i-\u0026gt;id, x, y); } This example just prints out every candidate that passes the index filter.\n/* Set up a query rectangle for index query */ const char* wkt_bounds = \u0026#34;POLYGON((20 20, 22 20, 22 22, 20 22, 20 20))\u0026#34;; GEOSGeometry* geom_query = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, wkt_bounds); /* Find all items that touch the bounds */ /* For non-rectangular query geometry, this will be an over-determined set */ GEOSSTRtree_query( tree, // STRTree to query geom_query, // GEOSGeometry query bounds itemQueryCallback, // Callback to process index entries that pass query NULL); // Userdata to hand to the callback The query itself just uses the tree, the query bounds geometry, the callback, and optional user data. You could use the user data to pass in an array to write results out to, or a prepared geometry to use for exact tests.\n","description":"Most programs using GEOS use the C API, rather than building against the C++ headers.

Stable ABI, since the complexity of the GEOS symbol space means that binary symbols are known to change between versions, even relatively small releases. However, if you are careful in restricting your usage you can build applications against the C++ API that avoid most issues:\nUse Geometry as your primary handle, and sub-classes like Point, LineString and Polygon as necessary.

Why does GEOS follow JTS design? Spatial Model Does GEOS support computation on the geodetic ellipsoid? Robustness Why does GEOSIntersects(GEOSIntersection(A, B), A) == false? Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t a computed point lie exactly on a line? Design and Architecture Why is the C++ API not kept stable? The C++ API is very large, and may have changes in every release. It is evolving to adopt modern C++ coding practices, and often has additions and removals as GEOS spatial algorithms get enhanced. Trying to provide a stable API would involve significant effort, and slow library evolution. The C API is significantly simpler (both in design and at the binary level), so it is much easier to keep stable.\nWhy does GEOS follow JTS design? GEOS started life as a port of JTS, so its design reflects that heritage. JTS is still evolving and improving, so keeping GEOS fairly close to the JTS design and organization makes it easier to keep porting JTS changes. However, there have been additions to GEOS which were not originally in JTS (although in some cases those were superseded by later JTS development). Also, GEOS is intended to provide high-performance spatial algorithms, which sometimes requires using different code patterns than in Java.\nSpatial Model Does GEOS support computation on the geodetic ellipsoid? No. GEOS assumes that geometries are defined in a Cartesian, planar, 2-dimensional space. Thus it cannot be used to compute accurate metrics, predicates or constructions on the geodetic ellipsoid which is usually used to model the surface of the Earth.\nOne way to perform geodetic computations is to project data to an appropriate planar projection using a transformation library such as PROJ. The desired geometric operations can be computed in planar space, and reprojected back to geodetic.\nRobustness Why does GEOSIntersects(GEOSIntersection(A, B), A) == false? GEOS represents geometry coordinates using IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers. This is a finite representation, whereas the implicit lines between vertices have infinite precision. In general it is highly unlikely that a coordinate computed via an arithmetic operation (such as a line intersection) is reported by an intersects test as lying exactly on the (theoretical) lines.\nFor example, the diagram below shows how the computed intersection point of two lines in general does not lie exactly on either line (scale exaggerated for clarity):\nWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t a computed point lie exactly on a line? As explained in the previous question, GEOS uses finite-precision floating point arithmetic. In general coordinates computed via arithmetic operations (such as interpolation along a line) is reported by an intersects test as lying exactly on the (theoretical) line. This is due to both round-off error during calculations, and also because in the general case it is not possible to represent points along a line exactly using finite-precision numbers.\nThe diagram below shows how points interpolated along a line rarely lie exactly on the line (scale exaggerated for clarity):\n","description":"Design and Architecture Why is the C++ API not kept stable?

The boolean predicates are pairwise tests for geometries that return true/false answers. \u0026ldquo;Intersects\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Contains\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Touches\u0026rdquo; are all examples of boolean predicates.\nThe old implementation in JTS and GEOS operated by building a complete topological relationship graph between the two inputs, then reading the result off the graph. However, computing the whole graph every time is computationally expensive, and the results of many predicates can be determined without a full graph \u0026ndash; the first time you hit an edge intersection, you know that geometries intersect, and you do not need to do any more calculations.\nThe new implementation, RelateNG, has a number of advantages:\nEfficient short-circuited evaluation of topological predicates (including matching custom DE-9IM matrix patterns) Optimized repeated evaluation of predicates against a single geometry via * cached spatial indexes (AKA \u0026ldquo;prepared mode\u0026rdquo;) Robust computation (only point-local geometry topology is computed, so invalid topology does not cause failures) GeometryCollection inputs containing mixed types and overlapping polygons are supported, using union semantics. Zero-length LineStrings are treated as being topologically identical to Points. Support for BoundaryNodeRules. The port to GEOS blends the new functionality with the existing implementation of PreparedGeometry and the C-API.\nAll one-shot predicates are now handled by RelateNG, and should in general be faster. These are called in Geometry.cpp. The default implementation in of prepared geometry, BasicPreparedGeometry.cpp now uses the RelateNG implementations. The existing implementations in PreparedPolygon.cpp, etc, still over-ride the defaults, because they are currently slightly faster. If/when the RelateNG implementations are optimized, they can be replaced. The C-API already had functions for things like GEOSPreparedTouches() even though the \u0026ldquo;touches\u0026rdquo; predicate had no prepared implementation, and was just calling the non-optimized predicate. These functions now end up using the RelateNG prepared implementation, so they should automatically be much faster. The C-API has been expanded with two new functions, GEOSPreparedRelate() and GEOSPreparedRelatePattern(), exposing a new feature of RelateNG, the ability to do accelerated relate matrix calculations. The RelateNG work has been run against the entire regression suite and returns exactly the same answers over all our collected 20 years of tests.\nThe only exception is the handling of a zero-length LineString, which is now treated as logically equivalent to a point. The RelateNG code is new and there are no doubt lots of places in the implementation that can still be tightened up. The existing pair-wise predicates can be considered deprecated, as the new implementation is faster and just as correct. The existing prepared geometry implementation is still faster, for the cases it supports, but for all the unsupported cases RelateNG now provides faster default implementations.\n","description":"The upcoming 3.13 release of GEOS includes a complete re-write of the \u0026ldquo;boolean predicates\u0026rdquo;, called \u0026ldquo;RelateNG\u0026rdquo;.

Proposals are available for review for at least two days, and a single veto is sufficient delay progress though ultimately a majority of members can pass a proposal.\nDetailed Process Proposals are announced on the geos-devel mailing list for discussion and voting, by any interested party, not just committee members. Proposals need to be available for review for at least two business days before a final decision can be made. Respondents may vote \u0026ldquo;+1\u0026rdquo; to indicate support for the proposal and a willingness to support implementation. Respondents may vote \u0026ldquo;-1\u0026rdquo; to veto a proposal, but must provide clear reasoning and alternate approaches to resolving the problem within the two days. A vote of -0 indicates mild disagreement, but has no effect. A 0 indicates no opinion. A +0 indicate mild support, but has no effect. Anyone may comment on proposals on the list, but only members of the Project Steering Committee\u0026rsquo;s votes will be counted. A proposal will be accepted if it receives +2 (including the author) and no vetoes (-1). If a proposal is vetoed, and it cannot be revised to satisfy all parties, then it can be resubmitted for an override vote in which a majority of all eligible voters indicating +1 is sufficient to pass it. Note that this is a majority of all committee members, not just those who actively vote. Upon completion of discussion and voting the author should announce whether they are proceeding (proposal accepted) or are withdrawing their proposal (vetoed). The Chair gets a vote. The Chair is responsible for keeping track of who is a member of the Project Steering Committee. Addition and removal of members from the committee, as well as selection of a Chair should be handled as a proposal to the committee. The Chair adjudicates in cases of disputes about voting. When is Vote Required? Any change to committee membership (new members, removing inactive members) Changes to project infrastructure (e.g. tool, location or substantive configuration) Anything that could cause backward compatibility issues. Adding substantial amounts of new code. Changing inter-subsystem API or objects. Issues of procedure. When releases should take place. Anything dealing with relationships with external entities such as OSGeo Anything that might be controversial. Observations The Chair is the ultimate adjudicator if things break down. The absolute majority rule can be used to override an obstructionist veto, but it is intended that in normal circumstances voters need to be convinced to withdraw their veto. We are trying to reach consensus. It is anticipated that separate \u0026ldquo;committees\u0026rdquo; will exist to manage conferences, documentation and web sites. That said, it is expected that the PSC will be the entity largely responsible for creating any such committees. Committee Membership The PSC is made up of individuals consisting of technical contributors (e.g. developers) and prominent members of the GEOS user community.\nAdding Members Any member of the geos-devel mailing list may nominate someone for committee membership at any time. Only existing PSC committee members may vote on new members. Nominees must receive a majority vote from existing members to be added to the PSC.\nStepping Down If for any reason a PSC member is not able to fully participate then they certainly are free to step down. If a member is not active (e.g. no voting, no IRC or email participation) for a period of two months then the committee reserves the right to seek nominations to fill that position.\nShould that person become active again (hey, it happens) then they would certainly be welcome, but would require a nomination.\nMembership Responsibilities Guiding Development Members should take an active role guiding the development of new features they feel passionate about. Once a change request has been accepted and given a green light to proceed does not mean the members are free of their obligation. PSC members voting \u0026ldquo;+1\u0026rdquo; for a change request are expected to stay engaged and ensure the change is implemented and documented in a way that is most beneficial to users. Note that this applies not only to change requests that affect code, but also those that affect the web site, technical infrastructure, policies and standards.\nIRC Meeting Attendance PSC members are expected to participate in pre-scheduled IRC development meetings. If known in advance that a member cannot attend a meeting, the member should let the meeting organizer know via e-mail.\nMailing List Participation PSC members are expected to be active on both the geos-devel mailing lists, subject to open source mailing list etiquette. Non-developer members of the PSC are not expected to respond to coding level questions on the developer mailing list, however they are expected to provide their thoughts and opinions on user level requirements and compatibility issues when RFC discussions take place.\nBootstrapping Note: The following is for historical interest only. The current PSC is available here.\nPrior to announcing itself, the PSC must distribute this RFC to the GEOS community via geos-devel for comment.

This information can be in the file headers, but should also be added to the project licensing file if not exactly matching normal project licensing (see [source:trunk/COPYING COPYING] file).\nExisting copyright headers and license text should never be stripped from a file. If a copyright holder wishes to give up copyright they must do so in writing to the OSGeo Foundation before copyright messages are removed. If license terms are changed it has to be by agreement (written in email is OK) of the copyright holders.\nWhen substantial contributions are added to a file (such as substantial patches) the author/contributor should be added to the list of copyright holders for the file.\nIf there is uncertainty about whether a change is proper to contribute to the code base, please seek more information from the project steering committee, or the foundation legal counsel.\nTechnical Responsibilities The following are considered good SVN commit practices for the GEOS project.\nUse meaningful descriptions for commit log entries.\nAdd a bug reference like \u0026ldquo;references #1232\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;closes #1232\u0026rdquo; at the end of the commit log entries when committing changes related to an existing [wiki:TracTickets Ticket] in the GEOS Trac database, so it\u0026rsquo;s properly linked on the Trac pages (see [wiki:TracLinks])\nChanges should not be committed in stable branches without a corresponding [wiki:TracTickets Ticket] number.

All access to the shared data is serialized.\nObjective Allow the GEOS CAPI to be thread safe.\nImplementation In order to implement the thread safe API, the current API will be copied and all static variables will be placed into a \u0026lsquo;handle.\u0026rsquo; This handle will be initialized on the initGeos call. Once initialized it will be passed to all subsequent GEOS functions, allowing each thread to have it\u0026rsquo;s own copy of the data. This will not affect the current API as it will be provided in addition to the old API. In order to prevent maintenance issues the OLD API will be changed to call the NEW API with a global handle. The handle (GEOSContextHandle_t) will be an opaque type to allow exentensions without recompilation being required. Function names in the new API will be updated with an _r, as is the familiar C standard for reentrant/thread safe versions. Current GEOS functions that do not make reference to the context handle will not be changed.\nThe intent will be to altogether replace the existing functions with the _r functions in a future release, making the thread safe versions the only supported functions.\nHandle Definition Here are the internals of the handle and how the application visual handle will look.\ntypedef struct GEOSContextHandleInternal { const void *geomFactory; GEOSMessageHandler NOTICE_MESSAGE; GEOSMessageHandler ERROR_MESSAGE; int WKBOutputDims; int WKBByteOrder; int initialized; } GEOSConextHandleInternal_t; typedef struct GEOSContextHandle_HS *GEOSContextHandle_t; The typedef for GEOSContextHandle_t will make it easier for the compiler to help detect an incorrect pointer being passed to the functions.\nExample Prototypes Here are examples of what some of the new function prototypes would be.\nGEOSContextHandle_t GEOS_DLL initGEOS_r( GEOSMessageHandler notice_function, GEOSMessageHandler error_function); extern void GEOS_DLL finishGEOS_r(GEOSContextHandle_t handle); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createPoint_r(GEOSContextHandle_t handle, GEOSCoordSequence* s); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createLinearRing_r(GEOSContextHandle_t handle, GEOSCoordSequence* s); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createLineString_r(GEOSContextHandle_t handle, GEOSCoordSequence* s); For comparison, here are the same functions as they exist now.\nextern void GEOS_DLL initGEOS(GEOSMessageHandler notice_function, GEOSMessageHandler error_function); extern void GEOS_DLL finishGEOS(void); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createPoint(GEOSCoordSequence* s); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createLinearRing(GEOSCoordSequence* s); extern GEOSGeometry GEOS_DLL *GEOSGeom_createLineString(GEOSCoordSequence* s); Limitations This change will focus on making a thread safe version of the API.

These extensions are beyond the current scope of this design, but this design will be implemented to allow such extensions in the future.\nTesting An example test executable will be provided that shows the current problem.

Even in small projects, contributing developers discover the problems of working without an agreed upon code format.\nThe utility of such guidelines has been proven by many open source software projects.\nThe scope of the proposal is specifically limited to formatting style guidelines. It is not an intention to develop a general coding guide covering other aspects of writing software like naming, etc.\nProposal It is important to make effortless for developers to produce properly formatted code.\nThe proposal suggests to use clang-format version 3.8 or higher to define C++ code formatting rules for GEOS code.\nThe clang-format is a tool to automatically format C/C++ code, so that developers don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about style issues. Unlike other tools which use own parsers, clang-format uses the Clang tokenizer and supports the same C++ source code as the Clang compiler. This guarantees correct output is produced and offers unique features (eg. wrapping long lines whether of code, strings, arrays - something which AStyle has no way of doing).\nThe style settings are defined in .clang-format configuration file for our style settings.\nThe clang-format is straightforward to run and can support development workflow as standalone tool or as one of many editor integrations or other bespoke utilities (eg. git cl format [Chromium]).\nNo automation of code reformatting is proposed. It would be treating the symptomps, no cause: developers not following the code formatting standard.\nAlthough no means to enforce the default formatting style are proposed, currently used CI services (eg. Travis CI) may be employed as a post-commit safety valve - a clang-format lint failure as a compile break (eg. clang_format.py build script used by MongoDB). Alternatively, a gatekeeper may be installed in SVN/Git, rejecting commits with code not conforming to the code formatting style.\nCode Formatting Rules What code formatting rules to use?\n\u0026ldquo;A mature engineers know that a standard is more important than which standard.\u0026rdquo; ~ MongoDB\nclang-format offers several defaults (eg. LLVM, Mozilla, Linux, Google C++ Style).\nThe proposal recommends to use one of the base styles, if necessary, fine-tuning as an easier way to get started than deciding on each option one by one.\nThe reasons are two-fold:\nmake GEOS code unified with the wide spectrum of well-established C/C++ projects long arguments and religious wars prevention. .clang-format Below is complete set of settings suggested, sufficient to maintain the clean code formatting style.\nNOTE: It remains open for refinements, use different BasedOnStyle as base style, etc.\n--- BasedOnStyle: Mozilla Language: Cpp Standard: Cpp03 ColumnLimit: 80 IndentWidth: 4 TabWidth: 4 UseTab: Never BraceWrapping: AfterClass: true AfterControlStatement: true AfterEnum: true AfterFunction: true AfterNamespace: true AfterObjCDeclaration: true AfterStruct: true AfterUnion: true BeforeCatch: true BeforeElse: true IndentBraces: false BreakBeforeBinaryOperators: None BreakBeforeBraces: Allman BreakBeforeTernaryOperators: true For brevity, the settings above are limited to the base style and points of customizations.\nFor actual implementation, full version of .clang-format should be generated using clang-format -dump-config option and the BasedOnStyle: Mozilla setting commented with #.\n.editorconfig [http://editorconfig.org/ EditorConfig] is currently in use and .editorconfig file is provided to automatically tell popular code editors about the basic style settings like indentation, whitespaces and end-of-line markers for distinguished types of plain text files.\nThe .editorconfig file will have to be updated to match the chosen .clang-format settings.\nEOL clang-format does not enforce line endings.\nThe EOL marker is considered to be [http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20130930/090200.html a part of a file encoding decision] and not part of any coding style.\nThe EOL marker can be enforced as project-wide setting controlled with .gitattributes and .editorconfig.\nHowever, it shall still be left as configurable setting in developer\u0026rsquo;s environment of choice (eg. git config) independently from the project-wide setting.\nBig Reformat What to do about the existing code?\nThe proposal recommends to just do one big reformat of the codebase.\nWhile it may seem causing clutter in the repository log (eg. svn blame), if it occurs infrequently (eg. yearly) and is applied to the entire codebase at that time, it should not be very disruptive to the source code history.

(C++03 was a bug fix release.)\nThe C++11 features aim to promote writing clean, compact, type-safe and fast code. It also delivers better feature-wise compatibility with C language (C99).\nThe Wikipedia article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11 does a great job describing all changes in C++11 extensively.\nThe std::auto_ptr smart pointer, together with a bunch of other features, has been deprecated and will be removed from C++17.\nThe new compilers provide better diagnostics.\nEnabling C++11 compilation mode will improve the programming environment making it much friendlier than C++98.\nA social factor: since (many) C++ programmers no longer enjoy C++98, allowing C++11 mode may increase potential for new contributions.\nCompilers Landscape Summary of compilers supported by GEOS with their minimal versions required to compile source code based on [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support C++11 features].\nC++11 Compiler Version Status Support GCC 4.8.1+ C++11 status Debian 8 (stable), Ubuntu 15.04+, Ubuntu 14.04 ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test, Fedora 19+, RHEL7 Clang 3.3+ C++11 status Debian 8 (stable), Ubuntu 14.04+, Fedora 19+, CentOS 6(?) MSVC 12.0+ (2013) C++11 status n/a C++14 The C++14 compilers are listed for comparison only:\nCompiler Version GCC 4.9+ Clang 3.4+ MSVC 14.0+ (2015) Plan This proposal only requests agreement for the C++11 compilation mode switch in the current trunk branch only.\nIf accepted, currently available build configurations (Autotools, CMake, NMake) will be updated to switch the compilation mode to C++11.\nThis proposal does not suggest any detailed roadmap of big refactoring of the GEOS C++ codebase.\nThe GEOS codebase is around 150 KLOC and given the available man-power to LOCs ratio, such one-step refactoring would not be feasible.\nInstead, the task will be tackled with the baby step approach gradually transforming the codebase according to priorities set along the way. Any disruptive refactoring, changes in interfaces of C++ classes, breaking changes in C++ API must be announced and discussed on the mailing list or the bug tracker.\nIMPORTANT: C++11 refactoring must not change the C API or break C API compatibility, unless agreed upon based on prior RFC proposed.\nHowever, if the proposal is accepted, any new C++ code written for GEOS can be C++11-compliant.\nPrior acceptance of this proposal is necessary in order to start any source code refactoring using C++11 features.\nOnce accepted, first step will be to update the build configurations to require C++11-compliant compiler.\nIssues This section outlines issues potentially caused by upgrade to C++11 language.\nC++11 destructors, by default, have now the new exception specification of nothrow(true). Destructors of GEOS classes should be reviewed and any that are allowed/expected to throw exceptions must be marked with nothrow(false). Otherwise, any user of the existing GEOS codebase would find the program terminating whenever GEOS destructor throws an exception. Such review would be beneficial anyway. Release First release of GEOS with C++11 compiler requirement could be 3.7.0 or, perhaps, 4.0.0.\nC++14 This section clarifies status of C++14 support in GEOS.\nOnce C++11 is adopted as default compilation mode, GEOS developers and maintainers must ensure it also successfully compiles in C++14 and C++17 modes. Are contributors allowed to add ifdef\u0026rsquo;s for C++14 and C++17? No. Is there a plan to upgrade to C++14 or C++17 to allow use of the C++ latest features? No, there is no plan. It is, however, recognized, such motion may be put to the vote around 2020.

By using WKB, systems can avoid exposing their particular internal implementation of geometry storage, for greater overall interoperability.\nGEOS can read and write three \u0026ldquo;flavours\u0026rdquo; of WKB:\nStandard WKB Extended WKB ISO WKB When reading WKB, GEOS will transparently detect the flavour of WKB and automatically read it. When writing WKB, the application developer must indicate what flavour of WKB to use, in particular when writing higher dimensional outputs.\nStandard WKB Standard WKB supports two-dimensional geometry, and is a proper subset of both extended WKB and ISO WKB.\nData Types The WKB specification uses three basic types common to most typed languages: an unsigned byte; a 4-byte unsigned integer; and an 8-byte IEEE double.\n// byte : 1 byte // uint32 : 32 bit unsigned integer (4 bytes) // double : double precision number (8 bytes) Byte Order In order to allow portability between systems with difference architectures, the representation of those types is conditioned by the wkbByteOrder.\nenum wkbByteOrder { wkbXDR = 0, // Big Endian wkbNDR = 1 // Little Endian }; A \u0026ldquo;little endian\u0026rdquo; integer has the least-significant bytes first, hence \u0026ldquo;little\u0026rdquo;. For example, the number 1, encoded in little- and big- endian:\n# Little endian 01 00 00 00 # Big endian 00 00 00 01 In practice this means that almost all WKB is encoded little endian, since most modern processors are little endian, but the existence of the wkbByteOrder allows WKB to transport geometry easily between systems of different endianness.\nCoordinates The double precision numbers in the coordinates are also subject to the byte order rules. To encode geometries with more than 2 dimensions, see the Extended WKB format below.\nPoint { double x; double y; }; Rings Linear rings are components of the polygon type, and never appear outside of the polygon. Hence they dispense with the byte order and geometry type, since both are implicit in their location in the polygon structure.\nLinearRing { uint32 numPoints; Point points[numPoints]; }; Empty Geometries For most geometry types, empty geometries are indicated naturally by having numPoints, numRings, or numGeometries = 0. Points do not have a numPoints field, so POINT EMPTY is represented by a Point with each ordinate value set to an IEEE-754 quiet NaN value (big endian 0x7ff8000000000000 or little endian 0x000000000000f87f).\nGeometry Types GEOS only supports the seven original simple features geometry types.\nenum wkbGeometryType { wkbPoint = 1, wkbLineString = 2, wkbPolygon = 3, wkbMultiPoint = 4, wkbMultiLineString = 5, wkbMultiPolygon = 6, wkbGeometryCollection = 7 }; Other systems (eg PostGIS) support a wider range of types (for example, CircularString, CurvePolygon), and hence more geometry type numbers, but GEOS is currently unable to consume those geometries.\nWKBPoint { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 1 Point point; }; WKBLineString { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 2 uint32 numPoints; Point points[numPoints]; }; WKBPolygon { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 3 uint32 numRings; LinearRing rings[numRings] } WKBMultiPoint { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 4 uint32 numWkbPoints; WKBPoint WKBPoints[numWkbPoints]; } WKBMultiLineString { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 5 uint32 num numWkbLineStrings; WKBLineString WKBLineStrings[numWkbLineStrings]; } wkbMultiPolygon { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 6 uint32 numWkbPolygons; WKBPolygon wkbPolygons[numWkbPolygons]; } WKBGeometry { union { WKBPoint point; WKBLineString linestring; WKBPolygon polygon; WKBGeometryCollection collection; WKBMultiPoint mpoint; WKBMultiLineString mlinestring; WKBMultiPolygon mpolygon; } } WKBGeometryCollection { byte byteOrder; uint32 wkbType; // 7 uint32 numWkbGeometries; WKBGeometry wkbGeometries[numWkbGeometries]; } Example The following bytes (in hex) make up the WKB for a LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1, 2 1):\n01 - byteOrder(wkbNDR) 02000000 - wkbType(LineString) 03000000 - numPoints(3) 0000000000000000 - x(0.0) 0000000000000000 - y(0.0) 000000000000F03F - x(1.0) 000000000000F03F - y(1.0) 0000000000000040 - x(2.0) 000000000000F03F - y(1.0) Extended WKB The original WKB specification made no allowances for adding extra dimensions, like Z and M, that are common in GIS applications. It also had no space for embedding a spatial reference identifier (SRID), which made it unusable as a database import/export format.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Extended WKB\u0026rdquo; variant is a superset of the standard WKB, which allows applications to optionally add extra dimensions, and optionally embed an SRID.\nThe presence of extra dimensions is indicated by adding flag bits to the existing wkbType that appears in all WKB geometries.\nFor example, here is the structure and flagging for a 3D point \u0026ndash; the dimensionaly flag indicates a Z dimension, and the point member therefore has three coordinates.\nwkbZ = 0x80000000 wkbM = 0x40000000 wkbSRID = 0x20000000 enum wkbGeometryTypeZ { wkbPoint = 1, wkbLineString = 2, wkbPolygon = 3, wkbMultiPoint = 4, wkbMultiLineString = 5, wkbMultiPolygon = 6, wkbGeometryCollection = 7, // | 0x80000000 wkbPointZ = 0x80000001, wkbLineStringZ = 0x80000002, wkbPolygonZ = 0x80000003, wkbMultiPointZ = 0x80000004, wkbMultiLineStringZ = 0x80000005, wkbMultiPolygonZ = 0x80000006, wkbGeometryCollectionZ = 0x80000007, } WKBPointZ { byte byteOrder; // wkbXDR or wkbNDR uint32 wkbType; // wkbPointZ = (wkbPoint | wkbZ) = 0x80000001 Point { Double x; Double y; Double z; } } When the optional wkbSRID is added to the wkbType, an SRID number is inserted after the wkbType number.\nWKBPointS { byte byteOrder; // wkbXDR or wkbNDR uint32 wkbType; // wkbPointS = (wkbPoint | wkbSRID) = 0x20000001 uint32 SRID; Point { Double x; Double y; } } The dimensionality and SRID flags can also be combined. Here is a 3D point with an embedded SRID.\nWKBPointS { byte byteOrder; // wkbXDR or wkbNDR uint32 wkbType; // wkbPointS = (wkbPoint | wbkZ | wkbSRID) = 0xA0000001 uint32 SRID; Point { Double x; Double y; Double z; } } Writing Extended WKB /* Read a linestring */ const char* linestring = \u0026#34;LINESTRING(0 0 1, 1 1 1, 2 1 2)\u0026#34;; GEOSWKBReader* reader = GEOSWKBReader_create(); GEOSGeom* geom = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, linestring); GEOSSetSRID(geom, 4326); /* Write it out as Extended WKB */ GEOSWKBWriter* writer = GEOSWKBWriter_create(); /* Next line only needed before GEOS 3.12 */ GEOSWKBWriter_setOutputDimension(writer, 3); GEOSWKBWriter_setFlavor(writer, GEOS_WKB_EXTENDED); GEOSWKBWriter_setIncludeSRID(writer, 1); /* Generate the WKB , and store the output length */ size_t wkb_size; unsigned char* wkb = GEOSWKBWriter_write(writer, geom, \u0026amp;wkb_size); /* do something ... */ /* Free the WKB */ GEOSFree(wkb); GEOSGeom_destroy(geom); ISO WKB ISO WKB was included in the ISO 13249-3 document (SQL/MM Part 3: Spatial). It allows for higher dimensional geometries, but does not have a facility for SRID embedding.\nGeometry Type As with extended WKB, ISO WKB supports higher dimensions by adding information to the wkbType number. Rather than using flag bits, however, ISO WKB simply adds a round number to the type number to indicate extra dimensions.\nwkbType + 1000 = wkbTypeZ wkbType + 2000 = wkbTypeM wkbType + 3000 = wkbTypeZM Writing ISO WKB /* Read a linestring */ const char* linestring = \u0026#34;LINESTRING(0 0 1, 1 1 1, 2 1 2)\u0026#34;; GEOSWKTReader* reader = GEOSWKTReader_create(); GEOSGeom* geom = GEOSWKTReader_read(reader, linestring); /* Write it out as ISO WKB */ GEOSWKBWriter* writer = GEOSWKBWriter_create(); /* Next line only needed before GEOS 3.12 */ GEOSWKBWriter_setOutputDimension(writer, 3); GEOSWKBWriter_setFlavor(writer, GEOS_WKB_ISO); /* Generate the WKB , and store the output length */ size_t wkb_size; unsigned char* wkb = GEOSWKBWriter_write(writer, geom, \u0026amp;wkb_size); /* do something ... */ /* Free the WKB */ GEOSFree(wkb); GEOSGeom_destroy(geom); GEOSWKBWriter_destroy(writer); GEOSWKTReader_destroy(reader); ","description":"\u0026ldquo;Well-known binary\u0026rdquo; is a scheme for writing a simple features geometry into a platform-independent array of bytes, usually for transport between systems or between programs.
