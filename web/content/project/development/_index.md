## Bug Reporting

Defects should be reported using
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/libgeos/geos/issues).

When submitting bugs caused by particular geometries, you must
**submit the geometries that cause the failure**, preferably in hex-encoded
[WKB]({{< ref "../../specifications/wkb" >}}), so that we can re-produce
the failure cases.

## Contributing

To contribute fixes to outstanding issues, enhancements, and other smaller
changes, open a [pull request](https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pulls) with
your change and a fullsome description of what you are trying to achieve.

If you have any doubts as to whether your work, or planned work,
is not a "smaller" change, please join the
[**geos-devel** mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geos-devel)
and describe your plans. **Join the list!** It is a great way to get
acquainted with what the development community is working on.

## Coding Style

For guidance on the coding style used in GEOS see the [**Developer Notes**](https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/main/DEVELOPER-NOTES.md).
